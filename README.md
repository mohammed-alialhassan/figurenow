## The Process

Starting the development of this app about 3 weeks ago, my goal was to first build the look of the app out and add the 
functionality as I went. I made it a priority for the app to be as responsive as possible and Xcode was a great tool for
that. It gave me the ability to run iOS simulator and build both the mobile and desktop viewports at the same time.
I also used Jira Confluence to track issues and bugs along with track progress.
